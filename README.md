# Objectify



**AI-Powered Visual Analysis Meets Music Discovery**

Objectify is an **AI-driven image analysis system** that connects visual understanding with music recommendation.  
It leverages **Googleâ€™s Gemini model** to extract detailed semantic and emotional attributes from an image, and correlates them with **Spotifyâ€™s music data** to generate a curated list of **10 tracks** that capture the mood, tone, and aesthetic of the visual content.

## How It Works

1. **Image Input**  
   Users upload or provide an image to Objectify.

2. **AI Image Interpretation**  
   The system uses **Geminiâ€™s inference capabilities** to analyze the image, identifying key attributes such as color palette, emotional tone, objects, and composition.

3. **Music Correlation**  
   Extracted attributes are mapped to **Spotify track metadata** (including mood, energy level, genre, and tempo), allowing the system to intelligently generate a set of **10 musically aligned recommendations**.

4. **Output**  
   The user receives:
   - A structured summary of the imageâ€™s defining attributes  
   - A dynamically generated Spotify playlist or track list reflecting the imageâ€™s mood
